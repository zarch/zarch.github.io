                <aside class="notes">
                    Introduction
                    Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source
                    software must comply with the following criteria:

                    1. Free Redistribution
                    The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of
                    an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license
                    shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

                    Rationale: By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we eliminate the temptation
                    for licensors to throw away many long-term gains to make short-term gains. If we didn't do this,
                    there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect.

                    2. Source Code
                    The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled
                    form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a
                    well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost,
                    preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form
                    in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed.
                    Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

                    Rationale: We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't evolve programs without
                    modifying them. Since our purpose is to make evolution easy, we require that modification be made
                    easy.

                    3. Derived Works
                    The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under
                    the same terms as the license of the original software.

                    Rationale: The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support independent peer review and rapid
                    evolutionary selection. For rapid evolution to happen, people need to be able to experiment with and
                    redistribute modifications.

                    4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
                    The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license
                    allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the
                    program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from
                    modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version
                    number from the original software.

                    Rationale: Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing, but users have a right to know who is
                    responsible for the software they are using. Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know
                    what they're being asked to support and protect their reputations.

                    Accordingly, an open-source license must guarantee that source be readily available, but may require
                    that it be distributed as pristine base sources plus patches. In this way, "unofficial" changes can
                    be made available but readily distinguished from the base source.

                    5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
                    The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

                    Rationale: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons
                    and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open sources. Therefore we forbid any
                    open-source license from locking anybody out of the process.

                    Some countries, including the United States, have export restrictions for certain types of software.
                    An OSD-conformant license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they
                    are obliged to obey the law; however, it may not incorporate such restrictions itself.

                    6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
                    The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor.
                    For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for
                    genetic research.

                    Rationale: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open source
                    from being used commercially. We want commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from
                    it.

                    7. Distribution of License
                    The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without
                    the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

                    Rationale: This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect means such as requiring
                    a non-disclosure agreement.

                    8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
                    The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular
                    software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed
                    within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should
                    have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software
                    distribution.

                    Rationale: This clause forecloses yet another class of license traps.

                    9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
                    The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the
                    licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on
                    the same medium must be open-source software.

                    Rationale: Distributors of open-source software have the right to make their own choices about their
                    own software.

                    Yes, the GPL v2 and v3 are conformant with this requirement. Software linked with GPLed libraries
                    only inherits the GPL if it forms a single work, not any software with which they are merely
                    distributed.

                    10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral
                    No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.

                    Rationale: This provision is aimed specifically at licenses which require an explicit gesture of
                    assent in order to establish a contract between licensor and licensee. Provisions mandating
                    so-called "click-wrap" may conflict with important methods of software distribution such as FTP
                    download, CD-ROM anthologies, and web mirroring; such provisions may also hinder code re-use.
                    Conformant licenses must allow for the possibility that (a) redistribution of the software will take
                    place over non-Web channels that do not support click-wrapping of the download, and that (b) the
                    covered code (or re-used portions of covered code) may run in a non-GUI environment that cannot
                    support popup dialogues.

                    The Open Source Definition was originally derived from the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).
